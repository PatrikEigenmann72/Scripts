# Bash Scripts Repository

Welcome to my personal Bash Scripts Repository! This repository contains a collection of useful Bash scripts primarly designed on MacOS to automate tasks, manage systems, and streamline workflows. I have
used Microsoft's Visual Studio Code for developing these scripts, and all my scripts are versioned and
have a very descriptive header information.

To get started with the repository, cd in your project's or development folder and run this git command.
